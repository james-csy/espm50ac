                <p>Because of the significance of the West Berkeley lot, it was named a landmark in 2000 and in 2020 was added to the list of Endangered Historical Places by the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Despite all of this, the lot was still owned by developers throughout the 2000 to 2020s. Returning the West Berkeley lot was no easy feat and multiple lawsuits & actions have been taken in the past decade. </p>
                <p>Starting in 2018, the lot was used by Spenger’s Fish Grotto as a parking lot, and more specifically owned through the company Ruegg & Ellsworth LLC. In the beginning, Ruegg & Ellsworth originally wanted to construct a grand apartment complex boasting over 250+ units. In doing so, the city countlessly denied their proposal and they started years of a legal battle. In the past few years, the parking lot moved for the Fourth Street Promenade, all the while, Ruegg & Ellsworth continuously attempted to obtain a building permit. </p>

            <p>Sogorea Te Land Trust (founded in 2012) is a woman-led trust foundation that endeavors into returning San Francisco Bay Area land to the Ohlone people based in East Bay, Oakland; righting the previous milenia of wrongs. In fact the work of Sogorea Te Land Trust inspired others in the US, most notably in Southern California. Besides returning land, they work in building ceremonial grounds and museums, in order to continue their culture and legacy. Ultimately, they were vital in the operation of acquiring the West Berkeley lot. In March 2024, Sogorea Te Land Trust and Berkeley city were able to buy the lot back for around $27 million USD. The Sogorea Te Land Trust donated $25.5m, while the city of Berkeley donated $1.5m. All was made possible after a unanimous decision was made by the Berkeley City Council to agree to the purchase.</p>
            <p>Now, the West Berkeley lot is being used to commemorate the Ohlone people instead. Instead of a parking lot, there are plans to convert the area into a green space and a place for the Ohlone tribe. There are rumors of a ceremonial burial ground or a museum or some kind of cultural center to praise and spread the history of the Ohlone tribe. Any new projects may take some time to finalize and start, but returning the land back in the first place is the best first step. Ultimately, Dana Ellsworth with Ruegg & Ellsworth, is quite relieved that the legal battle is over, and is satisfied with the conclusion. However, unfortunately, the city of Berkeley is still fined by the Alameda court around $3 million+ for delaying the legal issues within the site. Ultimately, there is still a lot to be celebrated because this is one of the largest land returns in the United States, and is projected to be the first human settlement in the Bay Area!</p>
