                <p>As previously explained, the Berkeley Shellmound lot is known for the Shellmound itself. Before the arrival of the Spaniards, the Ohlone tribe had built a shellmound in this lot. The shellmound was almost 20 feet tall, so it towered over the village. In the surrounding areas, the Ohlone people stayed in their village and on the other end there was a ceremonial burial site.</p>
                <p>As expected, this multiple acre piece of land was very important to them since their whole life revolved around these two acres. You are born on the land and you lay to rest on the same land. The shellmound was also used as a lookout, at its great height it posed very useful for the Ohlone tribe. During this peaceful period, they valued their land greatly. </p>
                <p>However, over time, once the Spanish arrived, the land was no longer their whole world. Essentially, they were forced out of the land and kicked out of their home they had for over 5000 years. In the late 1800s, they were moved to various camps and were taken advantage of. In fact, the shellmound that took years of sweat to build was destroyed instantly. Unfortunately, it was not for another 100 years before they were able to come back home.</p>
