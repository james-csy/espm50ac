            <p>The article explores the social, economic and political factors contributing to the ongoing People’s Park disputes. The multi-layered challenges present in the dispute were showcased through examining the different stakeholders that are involved such as UC Berkeley, the local government, the unhoused population, and park defenders. This directly relates to my project as the People’s park case study is a core component of the community displacement in Berkeley. The article also helps us to better understand the effectiveness and implications of university-led initiatives in historically significant areas. Given that the article is peer-reviewed and written by the American Association of Geographers, I believe it is quite credible.</p>

            <h3 class = "inknut-antiqua-extrabold">https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/04/uc-berkeley-peoples-park-police-operation</h3>
            <p>This news article follows the recent event in which hundreds of police officers conducted a surprise operation at night during winter break to clear activists and unhoused people from People’s Park. It is incredibly relevant to the project as it is a clear example of gentrification in Berkeley and the ongoing dispute around historical sites such as People’s Park. It is important to note that The Guardian is listed by bias checkers as having a left-center bias. However, the photographic evidence of officers in the article builds a strong case for the intensity and size of this operation. I will likely use this article to frame the current situation in Berkeley regarding People’s Park.</p>

            <h3 class = "inknut-antiqua-extrabold">https://www.berkeleyside.org/2023/11/28/people-of-the-park-profiles</h3>
            <p>This article documents the various people involved with People’s Park. There are various perspectives showcased in this article, ranging from Cal students, Volunteers, Residents, Artists, and Lawyers. The article also includes photographs of these individuals as well as audio interviews. This is extremely relevant as it provides a humane perspective on the People’s Park dispute. It is important to note that this article focuses largely on individuals that are pro-people's park; this bias should be accounted for by researching into articles with opposing views.</p>

            <h3 class = "inknut-antiqua-extrabold">https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/creating-space-reimagine-rematriate-beyond/docview/2716267393/se-2.</h3>
            <p>In Reynoso’s thesis she writes about how Sogorea Te’ Land Trust occurs and specific instances in history on how land returning has occurred. She examines different specific instances in Berkeley, like how remains of tribes are still at UC Berkeley and have yet to be returned (in 2022). Overall, this provides a really good background on how returning of land occurs and how complicated it may be. As it related to the West Berkeley lot, how it took decades before it occurred and how much trouble governing forces make for it to occur. It also provides insight on the broader implications of the socio-political dynamics of owning land in California and more. Hopefully, I can use this research to give background information on the Ohlone tribe and their land, and how difficult the process must have been to reclaim their land. </p>

            <h1 class = "just-another-hand-regular">Alternating Mapping</h2>
            <p>In chapter 3, called “Alternative Mapping: Tracking Solidarity to Sacred Land”, Berrios describes the relationship between communities and the environment. More specifically, discussing the specific case study of West Berkeley’s lot that is native Ohlone land. They explore the ongoing land rights battle and the indigenous sovereignty struggle in the bay area for over a hundred years. This is perfect for the website because it will cover good ground on the whole timeline of the West Berkeley lot and the struggle/work that went into reclaiming it back to the rightful owners. In addition, it will give a broader perspective in gentrification including the other side of the city of Berkeley.</p>

            <h1 class = "just-another-hand-regular">Project: Walking on Ohlone Land</h2>
            <p>This thesis explores Ohlone Land through a digital lens using AR/VR technology. It is very interesting because they follow Ohlone tribe’s land all throughout Berkeley, Emeryville and all of the Bay Area. This would be good for the website because it will provide background information on the Ohlone tribe as a whole and the various pieces of land that has been taken from them around the bay area. It is also interesting because it has been modernized more digitally in this thesis, therefore becoming more relevant for years to come.</p>
