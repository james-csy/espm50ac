                <p>For some context, I am an international student who grew up in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and Berkeley was my first real impression of the United States. Living next to People’s Park (unit 2) in my freshman year was a formative experience; it pushed me to explore the park, interact with its residents, and now research its history for this website.</p>
                <p>Ever since I enrolled at Cal, the notion that People’s Park was dangerous and to be avoided at all costs prevailed. I also held on to this viewpoint until I volunteered with the non-profit organization ‘Miracle Messages’, which reconnects unhoused individuals with their loved ones using social media. Volunteering challenged me to form my opinion on the topic with my own experiences rather than just what I heard and it is what prompted me to interact with the residents of People’s Park.

            <p>Although still cautious and having pepper spray as a safety measure, I was pleasantly surprised by the warm hospitality the individuals had in response to someone willing to engage with them in a well-intentioned way. This completely flipped my perception of People’s Park and reminded me that in many cases, the people living there are just looking to be treated like everyone else: someone that you can converse with and enjoy their company. Despite People’s Park being blocked off from the public, you can learn more about individuals involved with the park through this Berkeley Side article. </p>
            <p>People’s Park is a plot of land, Lot 1875-2 specifically, which is owned by the University of California, Berkeley. Throughout history, it has served as a “community-controlled” park, and plans for its development by the University of California have been ongoing since 1952. It may be surprising to hear that its development has been delayed by more than 50 years, but this is largely due to the persistence of the park’s community (students, activists, and local residents) to maintain the park’s nature.</p>
