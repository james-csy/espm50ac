                <p>At my first ESPM 50AC class, my GSI shared a video about the West Berkeley lot. Despite knowing nothing about the topic beforehand, I remember feeling moved that the Ohlone people only got their land back after decades of fighting. In addition, I have never been exposed to land right struggles or anything of that nature. I found it unbelievable that despite living and being on the land for years before others, the Ohlone people still had to fight for their given right. </p>
                <p>Growing up in Spain, I was never taught this side of the struggle, in fact Columbus day is celebrated and down my street there is a decorated Columbus statue. After doing more research on the topic, I feel ashamed that I was not well educated and hope for more successful land returns.</p>

            <p>Not only significant in history, but the West Berkeley lot is significant in size. Situated in Berkeley, California, a historically liberal and open community, it is surprising that only now has the land been returned. The lot is grand in size, spanning 2.2 acres located at 94710 Berkeley. This area is very close to the water and the actual Bay. The surrounding areas are quite gentrified, but the lot itself was used as a parking space.</p>
            <p>It is called Berkeley Shellmound because in the past a large shellmound was built and used as a lookout. What is a shellmound exactly? – It is an archaeological term for a tower-like structure made up of artifacts, like shells or seafood or bones and they are usually close to coastal areas.</p>
