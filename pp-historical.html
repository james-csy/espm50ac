                <p>In January 2024, there was a surge of hundreds of police officers that forced activists and the unhoused individuals of People’s Park out of the area. This occurred during the winter break when most of UC Berkeley’s students were out of town. </p>
                <p>It resulted in the park’s trees being felled and corrugated steel walls being erected in its place. During this time, the University of California faced legal challenges revolving around failing to adequately conduct an environmental review of its construction but claimed that clearing the park in preparation for construction was within its rights. </p>
                <p>Despite the large opposition against the University’s actions, we found that many students residing around the park felt much safer on their walks back home with the security personnel surrounding the park. </p>

            <p>In the 70s, Berkeley was under attack due to protests occurring at People's Park. At the time, the University of California, Berkeley, wanted to use the space to build university property and buildings. However, at the time, People’s Park boasted a community garden and great green space for everyone in the Berkeley community, including Cal students and staff.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, during one terrible evening, a day now known in history as Bloody Thursday occurred. Despite being concealed by many news articles in history, it was a ruthless massacre. The police arrived at UC Berkeley and opened fire on dozens of protestors. These protestors spanned different residences, as one traveled all the way from San Jose to support the cause. Sadly, there was an abundance of casualties such as blinding, and even one passing.</p>
            <p>In spite of the terrible violence, there was more backlash, as a curfew was instated and various armed forces were stationed around Berkeley. In fact, popular politicians like Ronald Reagan, reprimanded student protestors instead of apologizing for the siege.</p>
